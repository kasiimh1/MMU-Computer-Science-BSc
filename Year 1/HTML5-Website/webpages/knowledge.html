				<h3><u>Computer Science BSc in Year 1</u></h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Programming</li>
			</ol>

			<p>So far in Programming I have learnt to do the following, For & While Loops, Procedures, IF Statements and Animation, Top-Down design & funcations, Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
                
            <br>
			<br>
                
			Below is an example of me using For Loops in my programming.<img alt="Programming Screenshot" src="../Images/programming.png" title="Screenshot for Programming source code showing For Loops"></p>

			<ol>
				<li>Web Design & Development</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In Web Design & Development I haven't really learnt anything yet, as I did HTML5 within the last year. So it was easy for me to pick up the first assignment and produce a website using the HTML5 spec.
                
            <br>
			<br>
                
			Below is my Nav Bar from my first Assignment for Web Design & Development. <img alt="HTML5 Screenshot" src="../Images/html5.png" title="Screenshot for HTML5 source code showing my navigation bar within the website I created"></p>

			<ol>
				<li>Computer System Fundamentals</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In this unit we study both the Discrete Mathematics (Matrices & Vectors, Sets) part of CSF and the thoery side (Digital Logic, Boolean Algebra, Truth Tables and Karanaugh Maps).
                
            <br>

			Below is a Half Adder that I created in Logisim. <img alt="Screenshot for Logisim source code" src="../Images/CSF.png" title="Screenshot for a half adder in Logisim"></p>

			<ol>
				<li>Information Systems</li>
			</ol>

			<p>For Information Systems we have already handed in the first group assignment (ISSR Part 1). In that assignment we had to work as a team to spilt the work evenly and plan the work out, so everyone does the same amount of work and resulting in everyone putting in the same amount of effort.
                
            <br>
