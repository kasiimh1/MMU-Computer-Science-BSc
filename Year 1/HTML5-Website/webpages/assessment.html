				<h3><u>Strengths & Skills</u></h3>
                
			</header>

			<ol>
				<li>Team Work</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I have strong skills when it comes to working within a team, I can lead or help manage a team. I'm very good at planning, dividing workloads and offering help to others within the team.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Time Management</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I plan the work out so nothing is left to the last minute. I am very reliable when it comes to making sure the task is completed before the deadline, not leaving anything to the last minute.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Problem Solving</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I always come across problems that sometimes I can’t seem to solve straight away, so I take a break and think how I can attack the problem from another way (thinking outside the box). In the end I always manage to complete the task. Sometimes you need sometime and the ability to look at things in a different light, to realise you already have the solution.
