			<p>My Name is <strong>Kasim Hussain</strong> I am currently <strong>21</strong> years of age. I'm also in my first year studying Computer Science BSc at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). I moved from Birmingham to follow my dreams to become a Software Engineer. My road towards my goal hasn't been easy but like Steve Jobs said <cite>"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."</cite>
            </p>

				<p>Where Steve attended Stanford University in 2005 to give that speech to a bunch of students. <cite>"You've got to find what you love."</cite> Another iconic quote from the late Steve Jobs that he said to the students who attended the speech, to this day I stand by it, this is the reason why I am studying Computer Science because I love everything it's about.</p>

			<p>One of the main reasons why I chose to study Computer Science is because from a young age I had always been interested in the Computer Technology Digital space and keeping up to date in it. That wasn't enough for me though, I wanted to be one of the people that can push the hardware or software which will power the future devices in the years to come.
                
            <br>
			<br>
                
			I had always wanted to learn to code but I never had a starting point to my hardware orientated background. Picking Computer Science allows me to study something I have a passion for, giving me a start to the beginning of my journey to get where I want to be.
