Well I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I keep on trying
I should just let it go
I keep on singing
Your eyes, they just roll
It sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
You already know the story
And the chords are just the same
You already know I love you
And I sound like what's his name
But you can't stop me
I want you to know
I know it sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
